### Reflections and Comments

* I'm super glad i got to practice the if/else statements a bunch. It was the one thing I didnt really understand after 102 and now i feel much more comfrortable.

* I am really starting to get comfortable with CSS. its starting to make sense that you just name an element and then tell it what to do.
